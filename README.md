# yachay_ai

Yachay, an open-source ML platform, gathers extensive natural language data from diverse sources: traditional media, social media, messenger channels, tech blogs, GitHub, the dark web, and global legal proceedings.

In this project, we are given two separate datasets which we will use to help Yachay find a solution to predicting the geolocation of tweets.
